Metroid: Zero Chaos by biospark

This hack causes chaotic events to happen randomly while you play. There are two types of effects: one time effects and duration effects. One time effects are things that happen right away, such as freezing all enemies or spawning a power bomb. Duration effects occur over a random length of time, such as slower movement or deactivating an ability.

Apply the bps file to a Metroid: Zero Mission ROM using a patcher such as flips or beat.

If you play on bizhawk, you can use the included lua script to display the previous one time effect and the active duration effects (Tools > Lua Console, then Script > Open Script).

Softlocks are possible, so save often. I won't be fixing any softlocks that occur due to unfortunate circumstances (ex: a sprite blocking your path), but if there are any bad bugs, softlocks, or crashes, let me know and I'll fix them.

This was made using the mzm decomp. Thanks to yohann and everyone who has contributed to the decomp.
